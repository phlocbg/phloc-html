This Java 1.6 library lets you easily create DOM trees of HTML elements with an easy to use API that hides the underlying HTML names from you and can perform consistency checks on the created tree. Also offers a consistent way to create JavaScript code from Java, using structured objects (JSDOM). Depends on [phloc-commons](http://code.google.com/p/phloc-commons), [phloc-css](http://code.google.com/p/phloc-css) and [phloc-json](http://code.google.com/p/phloc-json). Read about the Maven setup in FirstSteps.

News and noteworthy:
  * Version 3.4.0 starts offering a DSL for creating JavaScript code in Java on the fly (JSDOM)
